4:1 Multiplexer Design Using Transmission Gates

Overview

This repository contains the design, implementation, and analysis of a 4:1 multiplexer (MUX) using transmission gates. The project showcases an efficient digital circuit approach focused on minimizing power consumption and propagation delay, making it suitable for high-speed, low-power applications.

Design Concept

A multiplexer is a crucial digital component that enables selection between multiple input signals, guided by control signals. In this design, a 4:1 MUX is constructed by cascading three 2:1 MUX stages:

Stage 1: Two 2:1 MUXes select between paired inputs.

Stage 2: The final 2:1 MUX determines the final output based on control signals S0 and S1.


Transmission gates are used as the switching elements due to their efficiency in reducing delay and power consumption. Composed of nMOS and pMOS transistors, transmission gates offer high-speed switching and minimal signal degradation, enhancing overall performance for applications requiring reliable, low-power MUX operation.
