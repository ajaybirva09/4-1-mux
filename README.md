## Project Description
Multiplexers (MUXes) are essential in digital circuits for selecting between multiple input signals based on control signals. This project demonstrates a 4:1 multiplexer design using transmission gates, which are known for their efficiency in reducing delay and power consumption. Transmission gates, constructed with complementary nMOS and pMOS transistors, provide high-speed switching with minimal signal degradation, making them suitable for reliable, low-power MUX operation.

## Design Concept
The 4:1 MUX design uses a cascading approach with three 2:1 MUX stages:
- **Stage 1**: Two 2:1 MUXes reduce the four inputs to two outputs.
- **Stage 2**: A final 2:1 MUX produces the final output based on control signals `S0` and `S1`.

Transmission gates are utilized as switching elements to reduce delay and power consumption. Their unique combination of nMOS and pMOS transistors allows for efficient switching with minimal signal loss, ideal for high-speed applications.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **/schematics/**: Contains schematics for the 2:1 and 4:1 MUX designs using transmission gates.
- **/simulation/**: Includes SPICE simulation files that test MUX functionality across different inputs and control scenarios.
- **/docs/**: Contains performance analysis data, including propagation delay, power consumption, and noise resilience metrics.

## Features
This design includes several features that make it advantageous in digital circuit applications:

- **Low Power Consumption**: Transmission gates reduce power loss, suitable for energy-efficient designs.
- **High Speed**: The use of transmission gates minimizes propagation delay, allowing for high-frequency switching.
- **Modular Design**: Cascading 2:1 MUXes enables scalable, modular construction for larger multiplexers.

## Performance Analysis
Key performance metrics include:

- **Propagation Delay**: Low delay due to efficient gate switching.
- **Power Efficiency**: Transmission gates require minimal power for switching, making them ideal for low-power designs.
- **Noise Resilience**: Simulation results indicate strong signal integrity across input voltages and frequencies.

## Future Scope
The design can be further enhanced through:
- **Delay Reduction**: Optimizing transistor sizing or gate configurations could further reduce propagation delay.
- **Power Efficiency Improvements**: Alternative materials or configurations may yield even lower power consumption.
- **Larger MUX Implementations**: This design can be expanded to 8:1 or 16:1 MUX configurations using a similar cascading approach.
