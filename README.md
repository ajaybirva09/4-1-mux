 # 4:1 Multiplexer Design 
 This project simulates the designed 4:1 MUX circuit to determine its performance characterisitics pre-layout design.

Note: Circuit requires further optimization to improve performance. Design yet to be modifi
## A Glance at the 4:1 MUX Reference IP
The 4:1 Multiplexer (MUX) Reference IP provides a high-performance digital multiplexer solution using transmission gates for efficient data selection and low power operation. Ideal for high-speed applications, this MUX is designed to offer low propagation delay and minimized power consumption, leveraging transmission gates to achieve reliable signal integrity across various frequencies.
