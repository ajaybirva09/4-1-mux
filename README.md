## Project Description
A multiplexer is a fundamental digital component that enables the selection between multiple input signals based on control signals. In this project, a 4:1 MUX is constructed by cascading three 2:1 MUX stages to achieve low power and fast signal switching using transmission gates. Transmission gates, composed of complementary nMOS and pMOS transistors, provide high-speed switching with minimal signal degradation, making this design highly efficient for applications requiring reliable, low-power MUX operation.

## Design Concept
The 4:1 MUX design uses a two-stage cascading approach:
- **Stage 1**: Two 2:1 MUXes are used to select between pairs of inputs, effectively reducing four input signals to two intermediate outputs.
- **Stage 2**: A final 2:1 MUX takes the two intermediate outputs from Stage 1 and selects the final output based on the control signals `S0` and `S1`.

Transmission gates act as the switching elements here, chosen for their ability to reduce delay and power consumption. Transmission gates allow fast switching with minimal signal loss, which is critical for high-speed, energy-sensitive applications.
