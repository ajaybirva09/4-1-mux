 # 4:1 Multiplexer Design 
 This project simulates the designed Bandgap Reference circuit to determine its performance characterisitics pre-layout and post-layout.

Note: Circuit requires further optimization to improve performance. Design yet to be modifi
## Overview
This repository contains the design, implementation, and analysis of a 4:1 multiplexer (MUX) using transmission gates. This digital circuit project focuses on minimizing power consumption and propagation delay, making it suitable for high-speed, low-power applications.
